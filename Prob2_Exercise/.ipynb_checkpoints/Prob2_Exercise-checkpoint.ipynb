To learn such a mapping subjects need to obtain knowledge of the error. Indeed, visual feedback at the end of the movement was provided in the experiments but only for clear feedback trials (i.e. $\\sigma_0$ trials).\n",

    "1. Suppose there is a movie that has made 50 million dollars at the box office so far. You don't know for how long the movie has been in the cinemas. What would be your guess for the total amount of money that the movie will make?\n",

    "2. Predict a person's age at which they will die given their current age. \n",

    "People's predictions for these two cases are shown in the graphs below. The values on the x-axis ('t') refers to the movie's box office intake so for (in million dollars) or the current age of the person (in years). The values on the y-axis ('t-total') refer to what people predicted (in the same units). The black dots show people's median predictions. The figures were taken from the publication.\n",
